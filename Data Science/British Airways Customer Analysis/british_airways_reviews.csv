✅ Trip Verified |  Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines. 
"✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
Not Verified |   I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
✅ Trip Verified |  I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually! "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
Not Verified |   British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
"Not Verified | I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
"Not Verified |  We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
"✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
"Not Verified |  LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
"Not Verified |  Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
✅ Trip Verified | Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
"Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
"Not Verified |   Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
"Not Verified |  BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
"Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
"Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
✅ Trip Verified |  That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
✅ Trip Verified |  Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
"Not Verified |  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
"Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
"✅ Trip Verified | I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
"Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
"✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
"Not Verified | I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels. "
"✅ Trip Verified | We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. "
✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
"✅ Trip Verified | Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
"Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
"Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
"Not Verified | Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid. "
✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
"Not Verified | Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
"✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food! "
✅ Trip Verified |  First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
"Not Verified |  Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
"Not Verified | This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
"Not Verified |  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving."
"✅ Trip Verified | I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future. The lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service."
"Not Verified |  Beware! BA don't provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason. My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money! They said they can't do anything to help, not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets! The most ridiculous thing I've heard!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!"
"Not Verified | All 4 of our flights were fine in terms of comfort, punctuality and service. I feel safe with BA and that is my main reason for booking with them even though I could travel with other airlines more directly. On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed. To serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable. Does BA actually pay experts to design these breakfasts? Low point on an otherwise good trip."
"cNot Verified |  I had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa. I’ll never fly BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money. I never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-BA flights were going. I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people. Worst service/airline ever."
"✅ Trip Verified | Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA A380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Credit to BA - Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great. Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. Nice one BA for 2 great flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. Overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all."
✅ Trip Verified |  The flight took off a little late due to Heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule. Boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient. A small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase. The cabin and toilets were very clean. Overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way!
"✅ Trip Verified | BA is great in the air! But... they sell you connections thru London Heathrow Terminal 5 (their private, BA-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, European flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate ON TIME and... book, security! Endless line, slow process. Your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the X ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings). Almost impossible to make. Lots of stress."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from Lisbon to London. I called to get some assistance from British Airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of €6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me."
✅ Trip Verified | Check in at MIA straightforward. BA use American flagship lounge near gate D30 which is excellent. Flight delayed but only by 1 hours. Boarding chaotic. On board staff were fine. Seat was fine too but product ageing. Post take off service prompt. Slept for 6 hours. I noticed that in club world BA have ditched rose champagne which is a shame. Pre arrival breakfast was ok. Slow to deplane. Luggage off ok.
"✅ Trip Verified |   Never I saw such a terrible customer experience. The plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays, the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages. After this long 1 hour boarding process, the captain did not apologise.  This is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight, forcing passengers to lose train connections to home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having not flown with BA for a few years, I read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say I boarded this flight with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest."
"✅ Trip Verified | Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert"
✅ Trip Verified |  Quick bag drop at First Wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal. Direct entry to Concorde room outside security south. Ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly. Concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar. Boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow. On board cabin crew excellent. Good choice of beverages and these were of high quality. Food was good. Seat comfortable. No first bedding provided. On time arrival into Miami. Baggage took 1 hour to arrive
"✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet."
"Not Verified |  Boarded on time, but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London, forms quickly filled in, and the bag was delivered the next morning."
✅ Trip Verified |  Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines. 
"✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
Not Verified |   I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
✅ Trip Verified |  I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually! "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
Not Verified |   British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
"Not Verified | I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
"Not Verified |  We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
"✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
"Not Verified |  LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
"Not Verified |  Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
✅ Trip Verified | Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
"Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
"Not Verified |   Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
"Not Verified |  BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
"Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
"Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
✅ Trip Verified |  That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
✅ Trip Verified |  Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
"Not Verified |  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
"Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
"✅ Trip Verified | I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
"Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
"✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
"Not Verified | I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels. "
"✅ Trip Verified | We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. "
✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
"✅ Trip Verified | Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
"Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
"Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
"Not Verified | Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid. "
✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
"Not Verified | Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
"✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food! "
✅ Trip Verified |  First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
"Not Verified |  Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
"Not Verified | This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
"Not Verified |  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving."
"✅ Trip Verified | I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future. The lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service."
"Not Verified |  Beware! BA don't provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason. My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money! They said they can't do anything to help, not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets! The most ridiculous thing I've heard!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!"
"Not Verified | All 4 of our flights were fine in terms of comfort, punctuality and service. I feel safe with BA and that is my main reason for booking with them even though I could travel with other airlines more directly. On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed. To serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable. Does BA actually pay experts to design these breakfasts? Low point on an otherwise good trip."
"cNot Verified |  I had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa. I’ll never fly BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money. I never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-BA flights were going. I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people. Worst service/airline ever."
"✅ Trip Verified | Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA A380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Credit to BA - Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great. Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. Nice one BA for 2 great flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. Overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all."
✅ Trip Verified |  The flight took off a little late due to Heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule. Boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient. A small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase. The cabin and toilets were very clean. Overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way!
"✅ Trip Verified | BA is great in the air! But... they sell you connections thru London Heathrow Terminal 5 (their private, BA-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, European flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate ON TIME and... book, security! Endless line, slow process. Your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the X ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings). Almost impossible to make. Lots of stress."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from Lisbon to London. I called to get some assistance from British Airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of €6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me."
✅ Trip Verified | Check in at MIA straightforward. BA use American flagship lounge near gate D30 which is excellent. Flight delayed but only by 1 hours. Boarding chaotic. On board staff were fine. Seat was fine too but product ageing. Post take off service prompt. Slept for 6 hours. I noticed that in club world BA have ditched rose champagne which is a shame. Pre arrival breakfast was ok. Slow to deplane. Luggage off ok.
"✅ Trip Verified |   Never I saw such a terrible customer experience. The plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays, the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages. After this long 1 hour boarding process, the captain did not apologise.  This is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight, forcing passengers to lose train connections to home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having not flown with BA for a few years, I read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say I boarded this flight with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest."
"✅ Trip Verified | Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert"
✅ Trip Verified |  Quick bag drop at First Wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal. Direct entry to Concorde room outside security south. Ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly. Concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar. Boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow. On board cabin crew excellent. Good choice of beverages and these were of high quality. Food was good. Seat comfortable. No first bedding provided. On time arrival into Miami. Baggage took 1 hour to arrive
"✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet."
"Not Verified |  Boarded on time, but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London, forms quickly filled in, and the bag was delivered the next morning."
✅ Trip Verified |  Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines. 
"✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
Not Verified |   I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
✅ Trip Verified |  I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually! "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
Not Verified |   British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
"Not Verified | I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
"Not Verified |  We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
"✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
"Not Verified |  LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
"Not Verified |  Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
✅ Trip Verified | Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
"Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
"Not Verified |   Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
"Not Verified |  BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
"Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
"Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
✅ Trip Verified |  That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
✅ Trip Verified |  Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
"Not Verified |  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
"Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
"✅ Trip Verified | I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
"Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
"✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
"Not Verified | I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels. "
"✅ Trip Verified | We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. "
✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
"✅ Trip Verified | Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
"Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
"Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
"Not Verified | Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid. "
✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
"Not Verified | Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
"✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food! "
✅ Trip Verified |  First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
"Not Verified |  Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company.

"✅ Trip Verified |  For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
"Not Verified | This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
"Not Verified |  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving."
"✅ Trip Verified | I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future. The lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service."
"Not Verified |  Beware! BA don't provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason. My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money! They said they can't do anything to help, not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets! The most ridiculous thing I've heard!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!"
"Not Verified | All 4 of our flights were fine in terms of comfort, punctuality and service. I feel safe with BA and that is my main reason for booking with them even though I could travel with other airlines more directly. On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed. To serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable. Does BA actually pay experts to design these breakfasts? Low point on an otherwise good trip."
"cNot Verified |  I had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa. I’ll never fly BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money. I never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-BA flights were going. I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people. Worst service/airline ever."
"✅ Trip Verified | Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA A380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Credit to BA - Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great. Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. Nice one BA for 2 great flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. Overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all."
✅ Trip Verified |  The flight took off a little late due to Heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule. Boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient. A small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase. The cabin and toilets were very clean. Overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way!
"✅ Trip Verified | BA is great in the air! But... they sell you connections thru London Heathrow Terminal 5 (their private, BA-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, European flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate ON TIME and... book, security! Endless line, slow process. Your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the X ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings). Almost impossible to make. Lots of stress."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from Lisbon to London. I called to get some assistance from British Airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of €6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me."
✅ Trip Verified | Check in at MIA straightforward. BA use American flagship lounge near gate D30 which is excellent. Flight delayed but only by 1 hours. Boarding chaotic. On board staff were fine. Seat was fine too but product ageing. Post take off service prompt. Slept for 6 hours. I noticed that in club world BA have ditched rose champagne which is a shame. Pre arrival breakfast was ok. Slow to deplane. Luggage off ok.
"✅ Trip Verified |   Never I saw such a terrible customer experience. The plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays, the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages. After this long 1 hour boarding process, the captain did not apologise.  This is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight, forcing passengers to lose train connections to home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having not flown with BA for a few years, I read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say I boarded this flight with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest."
"✅ Trip Verified | Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert"
✅ Trip Verified |  Quick bag drop at First Wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal. Direct entry to Concorde room outside security south. Ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly. Concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar. Boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow. On board cabin crew excellent. Good choice of beverages and these were of high quality. Food was good. Seat comfortable. No first bedding provided. On time arrival into Miami. Baggage took 1 hour to arrive
"✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet."
"Not Verified |  Boarded on time, but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London, forms quickly filled in, and the bag was delivered the next morning."
✅ Trip Verified |  Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines. 
"✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
Not Verified |   I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
✅ Trip Verified |  I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually! "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
Not Verified |   British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
"Not Verified | I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
"Not Verified |  We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
"✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
"Not Verified |  LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
"Not Verified |  Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
✅ Trip Verified | Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
"Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
"Not Verified |   Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
"Not Verified |  BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
"Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
"Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
✅ Trip Verified |  That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
✅ Trip Verified |  Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
"Not Verified |  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
"Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
"✅ Trip Verified | I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
"Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
"✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
"Not Verified | I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels. "
"✅ Trip Verified | We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. "
✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
"✅ Trip Verified | Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
"Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
"Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
"Not Verified | Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid. "
✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
"Not Verified | Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
"✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food! "
✅ Trip Verified |  First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
"Not Verified |  Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
"Not Verified | This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
"Not Verified |  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving."
"✅ Trip Verified | I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future. The lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service."
"Not Verified |  Beware! BA don't provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason. My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money! They said they can't do anything to help, not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets! The most ridiculous thing I've heard!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!"
"Not Verified | All 4 of our flights were fine in terms of comfort, punctuality and service. I feel safe with BA and that is my main reason for booking with them even though I could travel with other airlines more directly. On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed. To serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable. Does BA actually pay experts to design these breakfasts? Low point on an otherwise good trip."
"cNot Verified |  I had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa. I’ll never fly BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money. I never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-BA flights were going. I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people. Worst service/airline ever."
"✅ Trip Verified | Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA A380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Credit to BA - Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great. Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. Nice one BA for 2 great flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. Overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all."
✅ Trip Verified |  The flight took off a little late due to Heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule. Boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient. A small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase. The cabin and toilets were very clean. Overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way!
"✅ Trip Verified | BA is great in the air! But... they sell you connections thru London Heathrow Terminal 5 (their private, BA-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, European flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate ON TIME and... book, security! Endless line, slow process. Your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the X ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings). Almost impossible to make. Lots of stress."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from Lisbon to London. I called to get some assistance from British Airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of €6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me."
✅ Trip Verified | Check in at MIA straightforward. BA use American flagship lounge near gate D30 which is excellent. Flight delayed but only by 1 hours. Boarding chaotic. On board staff were fine. Seat was fine too but product ageing. Post take off service prompt. Slept for 6 hours. I noticed that in club world BA have ditched rose champagne which is a shame. Pre arrival breakfast was ok. Slow to deplane. Luggage off ok.
"✅ Trip Verified |   Never I saw such a terrible customer experience. The plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays, the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages. After this long 1 hour boarding process, the captain did not apologise.  This is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight, forcing passengers to lose train connections to home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having not flown with BA for a few years, I read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say I boarded this flight with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest."
"✅ Trip Verified | Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert"
✅ Trip Verified |  Quick bag drop at First Wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal. Direct entry to Concorde room outside security south. Ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly. Concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar. Boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow. On board cabin crew excellent. Good choice of beverages and these were of high quality. Food was good. Seat comfortable. No first bedding provided. On time arrival into Miami. Baggage took 1 hour to arrive
"✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet."
"Not Verified |  Boarded on time, but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London, forms quickly filled in, and the bag was delivered the next morning."
✅ Trip Verified |  Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines. 
"✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
Not Verified |   I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
✅ Trip Verified |  I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually! "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
Not Verified |   British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
"Not Verified | I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
"Not Verified |  We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
"✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
"Not Verified |  LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
"Not Verified |  Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
✅ Trip Verified | Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
"Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
"Not Verified |   Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
"Not Verified |  BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
"Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
"Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
✅ Trip Verified |  That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
✅ Trip Verified |  Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
"Not Verified |  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
"Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
"✅ Trip Verified | I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
"Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
"✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
"Not Verified | I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels. "
"✅ Trip Verified | We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. "
✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
"✅ Trip Verified | Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
"Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
"Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
"Not Verified | Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid. "
✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
"Not Verified | Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
"✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food! "
✅ Trip Verified |  First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
"Not Verified |  Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
"Not Verified | This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
"Not Verified |  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving."
"✅ Trip Verified | I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future. The lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service."
"Not Verified |  Beware! BA don't provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason. My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money! They said they can't do anything to help, not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets! The most ridiculous thing I've heard!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!"
"Not Verified | All 4 of our flights were fine in terms of comfort, punctuality and service. I feel safe with BA and that is my main reason for booking with them even though I could travel with other airlines more directly. On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed. To serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable. Does BA actually pay experts to design these breakfasts? Low point on an otherwise good trip."
"cNot Verified |  I had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa. I’ll never fly BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money. I never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-BA flights were going. I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people. Worst service/airline ever."
"✅ Trip Verified | Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA A380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Credit to BA - Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great. Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. Nice one BA for 2 great flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. Overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all."
✅ Trip Verified |  The flight took off a little late due to Heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule. Boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient. A small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase. The cabin and toilets were very clean. Overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way!
"✅ Trip Verified | BA is great in the air! But... they sell you connections thru London Heathrow Terminal 5 (their private, BA-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, European flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate ON TIME and... book, security! Endless line, slow process. Your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the X ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings). Almost impossible to make. Lots of stress."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from Lisbon to London. I called to get some assistance from British Airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of €6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me."
✅ Trip Verified | Check in at MIA straightforward. BA use American flagship lounge near gate D30 which is excellent. Flight delayed but only by 1 hours. Boarding chaotic. On board staff were fine. Seat was fine too but product ageing. Post take off service prompt. Slept for 6 hours. I noticed that in club world BA have ditched rose champagne which is a shame. Pre arrival breakfast was ok. Slow to deplane. Luggage off ok.
"✅ Trip Verified |   Never I saw such a terrible customer experience. The plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays, the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages. After this long 1 hour boarding process, the captain did not apologise.  This is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight, forcing passengers to lose train connections to home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having not flown with BA for a few years, I read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say I boarded this flight with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest."
"✅ Trip Verified | Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert"
✅ Trip Verified |  Quick bag drop at First Wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal. Direct entry to Concorde room outside security south. Ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly. Concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar. Boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow. On board cabin crew excellent. Good choice of beverages and these were of high quality. Food was good. Seat comfortable. No first bedding provided. On time arrival into Miami. Baggage took 1 hour to arrive
"✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet."
"Not Verified |  Boarded on time, but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London, forms quickly filled in, and the bag was delivered the next morning."
✅ Trip Verified |  Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines. 
"✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
Not Verified |   I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
✅ Trip Verified |  I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually! "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
Not Verified |   British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
"Not Verified | I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
"Not Verified |  We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
"✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
"Not Verified |  LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
"Not Verified |  Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
✅ Trip Verified | Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
"Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
"Not Verified |   Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
"Not Verified |  BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
"Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
"Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
✅ Trip Verified |  That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
✅ Trip Verified |  Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
"Not Verified |  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
"Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
"✅ Trip Verified | I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
"Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
"✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
"Not Verified | I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels. "
"✅ Trip Verified | We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. "
✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
"✅ Trip Verified | Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
"Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
"Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
"Not Verified | Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid. "
✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
"Not Verified | Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
"✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food! "
✅ Trip Verified |  First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
"Not Verified |  Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
"Not Verified | This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
"Not Verified |  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving."
"✅ Trip Verified | I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future. The lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service."
"Not Verified |  Beware! BA don't provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason. My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money! They said they can't do anything to help, not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets! The most ridiculous thing I've heard!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!"
"Not Verified | All 4 of our flights were fine in terms of comfort, punctuality and service. I feel safe with BA and that is my main reason for booking with them even though I could travel with other airlines more directly. On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed. To serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable. Does BA actually pay experts to design these breakfasts? Low point on an otherwise good trip."
"cNot Verified |  I had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa. I’ll never fly BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money. I never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-BA flights were going. I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people. Worst service/airline ever."
"✅ Trip Verified | Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA A380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Credit to BA - Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great. Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. Nice one BA for 2 great flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. Overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all."
✅ Trip Verified |  The flight took off a little late due to Heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule. Boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient. A small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase. The cabin and toilets were very clean. Overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way!
"✅ Trip Verified | BA is great in the air! But... they sell you connections thru London Heathrow Terminal 5 (their private, BA-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, European flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate ON TIME and... book, security! Endless line, slow process. Your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the X ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings). Almost impossible to make. Lots of stress."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from Lisbon to London. I called to get some assistance from British Airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of €6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me."
✅ Trip Verified | Check in at MIA straightforward. BA use American flagship lounge near gate D30 which is excellent. Flight delayed but only by 1 hours. Boarding chaotic. On board staff were fine. Seat was fine too but product ageing. Post take off service prompt. Slept for 6 hours. I noticed that in club world BA have ditched rose champagne which is a shame. Pre arrival breakfast was ok. Slow to deplane. Luggage off ok.
"✅ Trip Verified |   Never I saw such a terrible customer experience. The plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays, the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages. After this long 1 hour boarding process, the captain did not apologise.  This is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight, forcing passengers to lose train connections to home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having not flown with BA for a few years, I read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say I boarded this flight with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest."
"✅ Trip Verified | Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert"
✅ Trip Verified |  Quick bag drop at First Wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal. Direct entry to Concorde room outside security south. Ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly. Concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar. Boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow. On board cabin crew excellent. Good choice of beverages and these were of high quality. Food was good. Seat comfortable. No first bedding provided. On time arrival into Miami. Baggage took 1 hour to arrive
"✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet."
"Not Verified |  Boarded on time, but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London, forms quickly filled in, and the bag was delivered the next morning."
✅ Trip Verified |  Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines. 
"✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
Not Verified |   I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
✅ Trip Verified |  I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually! "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
Not Verified |   British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
"Not Verified | I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
"Not Verified |  We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
"✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
"Not Verified |  LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
"Not Verified |  Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
✅ Trip Verified | Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
"Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
"Not Verified |   Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
"Not Verified |  BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
"Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
"Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
✅ Trip Verified |  That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
✅ Trip Verified |  Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
"Not Verified |  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
"Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
"✅ Trip Verified | I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
"Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
"✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
"Not Verified | I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels. "
"✅ Trip Verified | We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. "
✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
"✅ Trip Verified | Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
"Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
"Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
"Not Verified | Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid. "
✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
"Not Verified | Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
"✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food! "
✅ Trip Verified |  First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
"Not Verified |  Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
"Not Verified | This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
"Not Verified |  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving."
"✅ Trip Verified | I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future. The lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service."
"Not Verified |  Beware! BA don't provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason. My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money! They said they can't do anything to help, not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets! The most ridiculous thing I've heard!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!"
"Not Verified | All 4 of our flights were fine in terms of comfort, punctuality and service. I feel safe with BA and that is my main reason for booking with them even though I could travel with other airlines more directly. On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed. To serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable. Does BA actually pay experts to design these breakfasts? Low point on an otherwise good trip."
"cNot Verified |  I had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa. I’ll never fly BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money. I never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-BA flights were going. I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people. Worst service/airline ever."
"✅ Trip Verified | Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA A380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Credit to BA - Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great. Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. Nice one BA for 2 great flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. Overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all."
✅ Trip Verified |  The flight took off a little late due to Heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule. Boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient. A small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase. The cabin and toilets were very clean. Overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way!
"✅ Trip Verified | BA is great in the air! But... they sell you connections thru London Heathrow Terminal 5 (their private, BA-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, European flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate ON TIME and... book, security! Endless line, slow process. Your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the X ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings). Almost impossible to make. Lots of stress."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from Lisbon to London. I called to get some assistance from British Airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of €6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me."
✅ Trip Verified | Check in at MIA straightforward. BA use American flagship lounge near gate D30 which is excellent. Flight delayed but only by 1 hours. Boarding chaotic. On board staff were fine. Seat was fine too but product ageing. Post take off service prompt. Slept for 6 hours. I noticed that in club world BA have ditched rose champagne which is a shame. Pre arrival breakfast was ok. Slow to deplane. Luggage off ok.
"✅ Trip Verified |   Never I saw such a terrible customer experience. The plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays, the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages. After this long 1 hour boarding process, the captain did not apologise.  This is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight, forcing passengers to lose train connections to home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having not flown with BA for a few years, I read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say I boarded this flight with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest."
"✅ Trip Verified | Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert"
✅ Trip Verified |  Quick bag drop at First Wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal. Direct entry to Concorde room outside security south. Ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly. Concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar. Boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow. On board cabin crew excellent. Good choice of beverages and these were of high quality. Food was good. Seat comfortable. No first bedding provided. On time arrival into Miami. Baggage took 1 hour to arrive
"✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet."
"Not Verified |  Boarded on time, but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London, forms quickly filled in, and the bag was delivered the next morning."
✅ Trip Verified |  Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines. 
"✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
Not Verified |   I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
✅ Trip Verified |  I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually! "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
Not Verified |   British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
"Not Verified | I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
"Not Verified |  We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
"✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
"Not Verified |  LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
"Not Verified |  Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
✅ Trip Verified | Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
"Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
"Not Verified |   Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
"Not Verified |  BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
"Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
"Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
✅ Trip Verified |  That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
✅ Trip Verified |  Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
"Not Verified |  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
"Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
"✅ Trip Verified | I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
"Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
"✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
"Not Verified | I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels. "
"✅ Trip Verified | We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. "
✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
"✅ Trip Verified | Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
"Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
"Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
"Not Verified | Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid. "
✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
"Not Verified | Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
"✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food! "
✅ Trip Verified |  First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
"Not Verified |  Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
"Not Verified | This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
"Not Verified |  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving."
"✅ Trip Verified | I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future. The lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service."
"Not Verified |  Beware! BA don't provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason. My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money! They said they can't do anything to help, not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets! The most ridiculous thing I've heard!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!"
"Not Verified | All 4 of our flights were fine in terms of comfort, punctuality and service. I feel safe with BA and that is my main reason for booking with them even though I could travel with other airlines more directly. On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed. To serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable. Does BA actually pay experts to design these breakfasts? Low point on an otherwise good trip."
"cNot Verified |  I had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa. I’ll never fly BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money. I never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-BA flights were going. I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people. Worst service/airline ever."
"✅ Trip Verified | Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA A380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Credit to BA - Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great. Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. Nice one BA for 2 great flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. Overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all."
✅ Trip Verified |  The flight took off a little late due to Heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule. Boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient. A small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase. The cabin and toilets were very clean. Overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way!
"✅ Trip Verified | BA is great in the air! But... they sell you connections thru London Heathrow Terminal 5 (their private, BA-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, European flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate ON TIME and... book, security! Endless line, slow process. Your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the X ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings). Almost impossible to make. Lots of stress."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from Lisbon to London. I called to get some assistance from British Airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of €6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me."
✅ Trip Verified | Check in at MIA straightforward. BA use American flagship lounge near gate D30 which is excellent. Flight delayed but only by 1 hours. Boarding chaotic. On board staff were fine. Seat was fine too but product ageing. Post take off service prompt. Slept for 6 hours. I noticed that in club world BA have ditched rose champagne which is a shame. Pre arrival breakfast was ok. Slow to deplane. Luggage off ok.
"✅ Trip Verified |   Never I saw such a terrible customer experience. The plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays, the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages. After this long 1 hour boarding process, the captain did not apologise.  This is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight, forcing passengers to lose train connections to home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having not flown with BA for a few years, I read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say I boarded this flight with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest."
"✅ Trip Verified | Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert"
✅ Trip Verified |  Quick bag drop at First Wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal. Direct entry to Concorde room outside security south. Ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly. Concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar. Boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow. On board cabin crew excellent. Good choice of beverages and these were of high quality. Food was good. Seat comfortable. No first bedding provided. On time arrival into Miami. Baggage took 1 hour to arrive
"✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet."
"Not Verified |  Boarded on time, but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London, forms quickly filled in, and the bag was delivered the next morning."
✅ Trip Verified |  Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines. 
"✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
Not Verified |   I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
✅ Trip Verified |  I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually! "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
Not Verified |   British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
"Not Verified | I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
"Not Verified |  We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
"✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
"Not Verified |  LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
"Not Verified |  Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
✅ Trip Verified | Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
"Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
"Not Verified |   Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
"Not Verified |  BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
"Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
"Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
✅ Trip Verified |  That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
✅ Trip Verified |  Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
"Not Verified |  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
"Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
"✅ Trip Verified | I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
"Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
"✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
"Not Verified | I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels. "
"✅ Trip Verified | We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. "
✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
"✅ Trip Verified | Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
"Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
"Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
"Not Verified | Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid. "
✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
"Not Verified | Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
"✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food! "
✅ Trip Verified |  First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
"Not Verified |  Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
"Not Verified | This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
"Not Verified |  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving."
"✅ Trip Verified | I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future. The lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service."
"Not Verified |  Beware! BA don't provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason. My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money! They said they can't do anything to help, not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets! The most ridiculous thing I've heard!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!"
"Not Verified | All 4 of our flights were fine in terms of comfort, punctuality and service. I feel safe with BA and that is my main reason for booking with them even though I could travel with other airlines more directly. On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed. To serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable. Does BA actually pay experts to design these breakfasts? Low point on an otherwise good trip."
"cNot Verified |  I had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa. I’ll never fly BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money. I never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-BA flights were going. I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people. Worst service/airline ever."
"✅ Trip Verified | Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA A380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Credit to BA - Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great. Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. Nice one BA for 2 great flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. Overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all."
✅ Trip Verified |  The flight took off a little late due to Heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule. Boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient. A small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase. The cabin and toilets were very clean. Overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way!
"✅ Trip Verified | BA is great in the air! But... they sell you connections thru London Heathrow Terminal 5 (their private, BA-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, European flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate ON TIME and... book, security! Endless line, slow process. Your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the X ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings). Almost impossible to make. Lots of stress."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from Lisbon to London. I called to get some assistance from British Airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of €6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me."
✅ Trip Verified | Check in at MIA straightforward. BA use American flagship lounge near gate D30 which is excellent. Flight delayed but only by 1 hours. Boarding chaotic. On board staff were fine. Seat was fine too but product ageing. Post take off service prompt. Slept for 6 hours. I noticed that in club world BA have ditched rose champagne which is a shame. Pre arrival breakfast was ok. Slow to deplane. Luggage off ok.
"✅ Trip Verified |   Never I saw such a terrible customer experience. The plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays, the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages. After this long 1 hour boarding process, the captain did not apologise.  This is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight, forcing passengers to lose train connections to home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having not flown with BA for a few years, I read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say I boarded this flight with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest."
"✅ Trip Verified | Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert"
✅ Trip Verified |  Quick bag drop at First Wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal. Direct entry to Concorde room outside security south. Ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly. Concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar. Boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow. On board cabin crew excellent. Good choice of beverages and these were of high quality. Food was good. Seat comfortable. No first bedding provided. On time arrival into Miami. Baggage took 1 hour to arrive
"✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet."
"Not Verified |  Boarded on time, but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London, forms quickly filled in, and the bag was delivered the next morning."
✅ Trip Verified |  Really terrible user experience. British Airways website is full of glitches. I can't even choose my own seat due to cookie problems. Never had this problem with any other airlines. 
"✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed with BA. Check in online was a little convoluted but once through that everything was great. We flew in standard economy and paid to choose our seats - this seems to be standard for all airlines now and how they keep initial prices down, but worth doing so we could sit together. Meals were excellent and drinks great. A simple water and biscuit on our short internal leg but still included and then 1 drink, 1 main meal and 1 snack on our 7 hour leg was better than our last trip on Emirates!! They gave out double drinks at drink service - that was 2 cokes and 2 beers for my partner and he was well pleased! Staff friendly, bags transfered and arrived in good condition and entertainment on route was good too. Will definitely choose BA again over other airlines."
"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months! Won't be travelling with BA for a long long time now - dated and poorly maintained on board products and appalling customer service."
Not Verified |   I flew from Malaga via LHR to Boston on the 4th May 2024 and on arrival in Boston discovered my luggage was still in London. Filed a report and now 4 days later no sign of the luggage. The baggage customer service is a joke. Not interested in the clients or giving a good service. Updates are useless. I know my luggage has been sitting in Boston since the 5th as I have an air tag inside it. The airline seem to have no intention of getting my luggage to me. The robots on FB messenger & twitter are useless. I opened a complaint & when I checked the update of my complaint the case had been closed despite never been contacted by a human!! This airline is now a joke and if I ever get my luggage back I doubt I will ever fly with them again. They are now worse than Air Canada in my book and that is saying something.
"✅ Trip Verified |  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above). Boarding procedures look well organized at the beginning, then during boarding become quite messy."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!"
"✅ Trip Verified |   I flew with British Airways from Heathrow to Hannover. Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price. Given my recent experience, I will avoid flying with BA whenever possible. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage."
✅ Trip Verified |  I have never seen such disrespect to a customer. It was the 3rd time in 2 months that I was unable to do a check-in because of their website not working properly. Lost 2 hours on the phone with their customer service team. At the airport I was asked to check in my hand luggage because they had no more space in the cabin. I could not recline my seat and the staff was rude and unhelpful to me. The wifi was also not working. I made multiple complaints and no one ever even contacted me. Never using them again!
"✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a ""gesture of goodwill"", something you don't deserve in their view. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers. I am a BA Silver member and have been a loyal BA customer for years. A disgrace."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible, lost my luggage on both flights, delivered 3 days later smashed to pieces. A lete departure caused me to miss the connecting flight, yielding a 7 hour delay. the aircraft was oversubscribed, dirty, with an unpleasant persistent odour. Food was genuinely horrible, I'm ex forces, I'll eat almost anything usually! "
"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway. On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her. Overall, I think my premium economy flight on BA is the worst experience in recent memory. As the British flagship carrier, they seem don't care, I emailed my sent my experience to their customer service, they responded with a standard corporate reply from one of their email templates..."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We chose Rotterdam and London City airport because of convenience, both small and having a hotel in the Docklands meant a short distance from City Airport. Three hours before our departure our flight was canceled however. Disappointing, but we made a swift move to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, but unfortunately we were offered a flight to Heathrow, which meant almost 1,5 hours by tube to our hotel. Flight back operated out of LCY to RTM, but had a 30 mins delay, so in terms of punctuality BA is not very reliant. The flights were okay, with a snack and a drink. The E190 being far more comfortable with 2-2 seating and more legroom than the A319. Our extra expenses for the cancelled flight were handled promptly and we got all the money for extra transport and food back, so BA did a good job in this respect. But hesitant to book again, though they are the only airline flying between RTM and LCY."
"✅ Trip Verified | The entire booking and ticketing experience has been stressful and erroneous. I booked directly with BA as I thought - why go to any other airline when their home headquarters is UK and I need to go to the UK. Mistake. This was months ago. I could not cancel or change my flight without paying them $750 to cancel my flight and have that money sitting for just 1 year on account, otherwise all was lost minus a few hundred in taxes. As whom I am really flying with is American Airlines and another partner I can't check in without being redirected. Then those sites don't recognize me. I don't appear in AA or Aer Lingus applications. I couldn't ask for more time to change planes in London despite all reviews saying how long and hard it is, as that would mean a cancel of plane ticket - loss of all money. I've been on the phone with agents for over an hour on 3 different calls. Their app will not let me in without each time a reset of passcode, a 30 minute wait for the email and then I get the same error."
Not Verified |   British Airways cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before. Automatically rebooked it for 2 days later. I called customer service 3 times trying to change it and they would Not help. My daughter was flying on a different reservation and because I am legally blind I needed to be on the same flight - they didn’t care nor would they help. We eventually bought new tickets on easyJet. When we arrive home I entered a complaint to get my fare refunded. It took them 4 months and then the response was it was cancelled because of a strike in Spain so they won’t refund it. EasyJet didn’t cancel. The whole experience was awful and so disappointing.
"Not Verified | I wanted to write this review so I could give a huge thank you to one of the staff on Lisbon named Jay Ramphul. She went above and beyond and really helped me in an urgent situation. I had boarded my flight with 20 minutes before take off when I realized I had left my cell phone in the club lounge. I was not going to get permission to deboard and get back on in time for take off. Jay stepped in and made it happened. She literally ran with me a far distance to retrieve my phone with me and get me back on the plane within minutes of take off. This is true service! I don't know if this review will ever get back to her or her management, but I hope it does. I want to again express my gratitude for her help and kindness in this matter."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight"
"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess. Not at all a premium service, this felt more like a low cost carrier doing “business”."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew business class from Doha to London on 31st March. The service was slow and unfriendly, even one of the male cabin crew working in business class asked the female cabin crew who was looking after the area where I was in to smile. I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly. For lunch, the bread roll was so dry and rock hard that I couldn’t cut through the ends. Not sure why the food and service was so bad on this flight as generally BA food is good and is well presented. Also, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working on the flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service."
"Not Verified |  We have flown this route with EasyJet regularly for more than twenty years but at the age of 80, boarding at Nice has become so chaotic and wearing l decided to pay the significant extra amount to see if BA was better. The outward flight from Heathrow was not great but acceptable but when l attempted to checkin for the return l discovered that we did not have a booking. At the time l booked l was recovering from a serious illness and assumed that l must have made a mistake. After considerable panic, l booked last minute flights at considerable cost with EasyJet, boarding being the usual shambles. Flying into Gatwick rather than Heathrow the only way to get home was a £120 taxi rather than a £2 bus fare from Heathrow. On arrival home l discovered that I did have an email confirmation of the return flight from BA, so immediately contacted them to complain and ask for financial compensation. In the two weeks since they have sent two apologies for their slow response but nothing else so far. We have elderly friends who say that they now find travelling with British Airways so stressful that they will not travel outside the UK again. This will help the environment but it seems remarkable that the airline industry in the UK has deteriorated to this extent. Unfortunately JAL or Singapore, both of which l have used happily over many years, do not fly within Europe."
"✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like ""what do you want and why are you disturbing me"". Other than those points a generally good flight and on time arrival to HND."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Overall I would say disappointing. Due to BA status I had lounge access, on the small side and very busy. The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had."
"Not Verified |  LHR to Delhi in Business. Exceptional flight. Stylish and quirky B Gates lounge with interesting, modern and eclectic food plus Whispering Angel bar. Food on board was delicious and well presented. Friendly, fun, relaxed crew with a blend of deference, self-deprecation and over familiarity. Been flying BA for 35 years in various classes, and this was probably the best. Great job BA!"
"Not Verified |  Efficient and Smooth flight from start to finish. Cabin crew attentive and bubbly. Very clean aircraft. Mcvities snacks a nice touch, and even the coffee in a bag was unexpectedly nice. Everything to praise, and nothing to complain about!"
✅ Trip Verified | Was told we can not take hand luggage onto the plane as all overhead cabins were already full. So had to put them in the hold when we at the aircraft door. Frustrating as we had just hand luggage to avoid delays at Heathrow. Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.
"Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply."
"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process. We would definitely consider flying trans-Atlantic with BA again, as we received value and service for the fare we paid."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited an hour to check-in at the Paphos business check-in. Staff utterly incompetent. Flight crew in business class removed my ruck sack from the flight bins without my consent to make way for another customer luggage. I was then coerced to have my luggage at my feet throughout my flight. Utterly outrageous, last thing you would expect in BA business class."
"Not Verified |   Not a great experience at all, from the outset it was poorly managed as they bused us out to a parking slot only to have us wait for 15 minutes in the bus as the plane was ready. BA business class is not Business class. Tired, small and generally not worth the ticket price. Tables that don’t sit straight, arm rests that aren’t secure and terrible screens. It’s not a patch on first class airlines which is apparently where BA think they should be. They have a long way to go."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was difficult caused by vast majority of the passengers carrying too much hand luggage. FA's were friendly. The seats on BA for European flights are extremely narrow. There was a choice of breakfast and very surprising the Champagne Castelau on European flights is of a better quality as the brand used in club on intercontinental flight. Nothing wrong with this flight, however not pleasant due to the unpleasant seats. Waiting time at Brussels for luggage some 20 minutes what is very acceptable."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding started with a delay of some 20 minutes , everybody could see members of the team only did arrive 5 en 3 minutes before the announced boarding time. We had to wait outside for nearly 15 minutes . It was hot ! Unfortunately flying from Barbados to London in Club Class was an underwhelming experience. BA is not performing a great performance on international flights anymore. Lucky the 777 had the new configuration. As welcome aboard Champagne or fruit juice, the glasses were filled at the level of one inch. A far cheaper brand of Champagne Heidsieck Monopole and no more rosé Champagne available. Wines also poor, there was no French wine. Cognac is also not available anymore. My meal was sub par : the steak was replaced by beef stew. and the FA made it very clear : dessert or cheese. not both. After some 4 hours flight there was no more ice available. Minimal information from the flight deck. breakfast not suitable at all for a business class. Some of the FA were friendly, others not at all. Far from pleasant experience despite the high fares !"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible customer service - will never fly again. We left Toronto for London, and then missed our connecting flight from London to Mumbai,  so we had to book with a different airline and pay the costs. They then cancelled our return flight (3 weeks later) from Mumbai to Toronto without notifying us. We just happened to find out when we tried to check in on the day of. We are now stuck in Mumbai with 3 small kids, no return flights.  First and last time flying with them."
"Not Verified |  BA is not what it used to be! As much as I like their onboard crew their check in staff lacked interest in their job and safety. At no point did he make eye contact or ask Security questions and counters opened 7 minutes late. Crew from CPH was wonderful but announcements were too loud and too many,  maybe I was just grumpy! Took less than 15 to get out of LHR through self service and transfer to LGW was a breeze. Crew on the POS sector was OK, had an aisle Seat and was bumped into by a cabin crew booty continuously for 9 hours. Not her fault but could never relax fully. One Caribbean Crew excelled and joined the Carnival spirit most passengers were feeling onboard. I wonder if BA management ever tasted the food onboard? Absolutely tasteless and some of the worst. I saved €550 choosing BA over KLM which was the only reason I chose Them. KLM is definitely a league over BA in many aspects and no need to change airports."
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA First, it's not even the best business class in the sky. Cabin very long in the tooth. Service extremely inattentive and lackadaisical. Been waiting over an hour to be offered after dinner drinks or dessert. Nothing. Just awful value for money."
"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst business class experience. Ground crew in Singapore were friendly I ended up switching lounges from BA to QF. The aircraft was late 1 hour. The cabin crew in business class were some of the most unfriendliest crew I have experienced. No one smiled not welcomed on board. No body was checking though out the flight if i wanted anything. I found my seat sat down and waited for someone to offer me a refreshment. Nobody came. A stewardess approached a passenger sitting infront of me if he'd been offer a refreshment he said no, i looked at her and made eye contact. she looked at me and walked straight past. Observing some of the other passenger the crew did not assist any of the ladies struggling to put their carry on luggage in the overhead. During the entire flight all the staff felt like they hated being on the flight and did not want to work. When disembarking walked past 4 crew not one was saying goodbye and thank you to any passengers. The food I had was average, I had a cocktail it was OK. The wine selection was below average."
"Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price."
"Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  On the my trip to Mexico City, I had the opportunity to experience BA long-haul business class for the first time and it was extremely underwhelming. First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board. They looked great on menu card but were quite bad when they are served.I would not recommend BA business class product based on this experience."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I upgraded at check in to Club Europe seat 1D and had an excellent experience with BA. The check-in at the airport was very quick and smooth, with friendly staff. Once through the fast track I headed for the Galleries lounge at LHR T3 and this exceeded my expectations. The food was really good and I had a superb view out over the runway. The flight was great. Some people have remarked that legroom isn’t good even in Club Europe but I found it fine for a 2 hour flight. ‘Afternoon tea’ was delicious. Cabin crew were excellent. I was out the airport in about 10 minutes from landing. BA did a superb job on this flight."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought a return trip with BA, through Webjet Australia last year. I would fly from Sydney to Porto middle of June with no problem. But I had to return earlier to Australia. So I requested a change in the dates from March to January. I should point out that BA partners changed the details of the return flight many times. That is not a problem. The problem is that although I was flexible with the dates they refused to fly me back. I had to buy a ticket from another company to travel to Australia. Later I asked for a change of the return date to January of next year. Again that was turned down. I will keep in mind this negative experience with BA when booking future trips."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Poor from start to finish. Six months after purchasing our tickets I added an extra bag at the exorbitant cost of £130, but this transaction failed to make the system. I rang BA customer services only to be cut off without a reply. At LHR a manager had to be summoned to verify my printed receipt of payment. I was assured there would be no problem on the return trip. Wrong. Same experience at LIS! On board, an hour delay because of late discovery of technical fault. Old plane, with an uncomfortable seat with minimal legroom. Soggy cookie and small bottle of water offered free. Return trip, even more uncomfortable seat, made worse by the extra recline the passenger in front of me enjoyed due to his knackered seat. Once upon a time BA stood for something. No longer. Next time it is TAP, with their much newer planes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Communication and customer service non existent, they make me pay for seat on my return flight from Madrid to London, where didn’t should be as my ticket was premium economy. On the time of check in just was able do BA-MAD but to not MAD-LHR just in Madrid they issued boarding pass changed my seat from 5F to 19F worst seat ever, explained rudeness on Madrid - plane changed. That section is Business and you are premium only, we send you to the back,, no apologies, no answer complaints, low cost airlines treat you better, refund of seat received but zero apologies."
✅ Trip Verified |  That was supposed to be my flight but it was cancelled 12 hours before takeoff. After nearly 4 months BA finally responded to my compensation claim confirming I was due statutory compensation. Another 2 months later and still not received it despite chasing. According to BA my bank must have lost the payment so now apparently my problem again. From my experience a once great airline now with customer service no better than the worst of the low cost carriers.
✅ Trip Verified |  Have no fear when your BA flight is operated by Finnair. The business class seats offer more leg room than the BA offering and the service just could not have been better. Food (BA) was good too. Excellent flight arriving so much ahead of schedule that there was a delay disembarking as there was no one available at LHR to pilot the bridge.
"Not Verified |  We have flown BA five times from western USA to England. Always decent service. Never again. If you have a problem their website is impossible to navigate. It’s terrible,  takes you in endless repeating circles and loops that never lead to any resolutions. They lost our suitcase. We spent hours upon our arrival in Lisbon trying to navigate their website. It was frustrating and fruitless. Three days into our trip and we still are waiting for our clothing and toiletries and electronics. Can we talk to a real person? No. It’s impossible. We have even quit thinking about the $396 we spent to secure seats in Economy that turned out to have no extra legroom. We paid $400 extra for nothing. We are done with BA. Whoops, not quite. We still have to get home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates."
"Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future."
"✅ Trip Verified | I am a British Airways Gold Guest List member (with Lifetime privileges). In spite of that I have given up Britsh wherever possible. I take ten or more trans ocean trips a year. I am fortunate to be able to fly First Class - unfortunately British no longer has a First Class product - the sell one by that name at First Class prices but in fairness deliver what you would consider a very good Business Class experience. I should point out that there are airlines who sell Business Class that in fact are better than any British First Class experience (Qatar, Emirates). I have flown many millions of miles on British. Last week I completed an around the world trip on Emirates and Qantas all A380. In the millions of BA miles I never had an experience as good as what I experience on EK and Qantas. A very long time ago the food and beverage service on BA was truly extraordinary - today it would be a bit of a stretch to even call it ordinary - so sad a decline. Seat comfort (in First), lounges food, beverage all need serious rework. If you are a First Class traveler British is just not an option. Sad, truly sad."
"Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith? Only giving 1 out of 10 because I cannot mark it as zero to reflect the zero service received."
"✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team. Their meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction reaffirmed my faith in British Airways as a paragon of excellence within the aviation industry."
"Not Verified | I did not actually get to fly with BA as they cancelled the flight with 3 days notice and refused to offer an acceptable alternative, resulting in 2 people losing their holiday (a river cruise). Since then, as appears to be their standard protocol, they have ignored every communication regarding their obligations for compensation and I have no option but to pursue them via official channels. "
"✅ Trip Verified | We had possibly the worse check-in experience ever this ever. It took nearly 50 minutes of phone calls and numerous staff to check us in for a redemption flight through our account. Utterly bizarre situation for a procedure we’ve done without hitch for the last 20 years. Once onboard we were so disappointed to have the old style Club World seats that meaning stepping over your fellow passengers to use the toilets. Why on earth are these still in use they feel so dated. The saving grace, as is quite often the case, was some fabulous cabin crew that were amazing. I have fed back to BA direct to sing their praises. Fingers crossed for the return leg."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to LHR from ATH in Club Europe with BA641 on Dec 31 to transfer to a JAL flight back to Tokyo. At first, I had no great expectations of what services I would enjoy on board, partly because its flight time was less than 4 hours and because the seat configuration of Club Europe was the typical European Business Class with the middle seat empty. Afterward, on board, remembering that I took the same route with BA more than 30 years ago, I got to feel relaxed by their unobtrusive and courteous services. When I asked for a champagne refill a couple of times, a benign smile would come to me."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I like the British Airways World Traveller Plus product. The seats are comfy and the food is good. The crew on this flight were very attentive and friendly especially the CSM who came round and introduced herself to us and made sure we were comfortable. The bars closed half way through the flight to Cancun as they can’t uplift more alcoholic drinks in Cancun. Juice, water, tea and coffee is available. Very full flight. My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the £100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight. It’s an upgraded version of Economy, where as other airlines like Qantas and Singapore Airlines are Business minus. Still worth the extra though."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have come to boarding and my cabin luggage was taken, ""because the plane is full"". I asked to take it to the cabin, because I have large notebook and  electronics in it, but nothing changes. So, now I am sitting in the plane, holding notebook and several packs from my luggage, and think of how I will stand with all this stuff in my hands in a passport control line in Warsaw. Other people around me have come to the plane with cabin luggage!"
"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. "
✅ Trip Verified | Worst service ever. Lost baggage because of delayed flight and missed connection and no one is helping to get it back. British Airways website is broken so it doesn’t let me fill missing report and doesn’t give me missing file report number and so no way to contact British Airways because they have dumbest ever AI chatbot.
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 246 21JAN 2023 Did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude of the pilots. Flight scheduled departure 16:20. Advised boarding time 15:20. Whole flight full of passengers waiting at the gate to board at 15:20. 15:40 the cabin crew board. 15:55 the pilots board - each with a Sao Paulo Airport Duty Free branded shopping bag. 16:20 the flight is still boarding. Finally pushes back just before 17:00, 40 minutes late. Captain came on the intercom to announce the delay was due to 'traffic between the crew hotel and the airport'. Sorry Captain the whole plane saw you and your pilot colleagues board fifteen minutes after the cabin crew clutching your duty free that you and your pilot colleagues still made time to stop for."
"✅ Trip Verified | Not a great experience. I could not check in online as two separate parts of the BA computer system do not talk to each other. At LHR a delightful check in clerk sorted it quickly, manually! We boarded on time, but luggage loading had to be halted as the Captain spotted a technical issue and an engineer was called. By the time it was sorted we had missed our slot so took off an hour behind schedule. The flight was uneventful, but the plane had clearly seen better days, legroom was appalling and the handout of a small bottle of water and a soggy cookie made one wish for the days when flying BA meant something special. Next time it will be Jet2."
"Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids."
"Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us."
"Not Verified | Paid for business class travelling Cairo to London Heathrow but all I got was an economy seat. Only difference from economy is middle seat was vacant. Couldn't recline, no entertainment for the 5hr+ flight, uncomfortable seat and disgusting food. Put in a formal complaint 3 days ago and had no reply. BA's account on X is hacked. Got approached by scammers after posting there and even after flagging this to BA nothing done about it. Just disgusting. Avoid. "
✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was extremely dirty with chocolate smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property. Zero customer service for their regular customers and this all could have been mitigated if they had been willing to help at the very beginning - very disappointed.
"Not Verified | Overall journey wasn’t bad however at the end, the baggage arrival nearly took 1.5 hours (more than actual flight time). Baggage of other flights arriving after had been delivered whereas the baggage staff on airport had no clue and information as to why baggage of this flight hasn’t arrived. They raised their hands saying they can’t do anything further. Poor communication and no customer facing skills."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall very satisfied. Ground staff member at YVR was extremely helpful & courteous. A350 was only a few months old, so seats were in good order & comfortable by the standards of a modern day Y class seat, although the very small washroom was already starting to look a bit shabby. Cabin crew very friendly & professional, & meal service carried out at reasonable time in the flight. Choice of 2 options for the main meal which was the same for both legs of my journey 1 month apart. Flight departed on time but unfortunately upon landing at LHR we were unable to deplane for quite some time due to a staffing issue at LHR which so not the fault of the airline, and we were given frequent updates on the situation from the flight manager & the flight deck."
"✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food! "
✅ Trip Verified |  First time using BA business class but we were pleased with the service received. No one was waiting at check in/bag drop and through security in 2 minutes. We used the lounge in the b gates area which we found quiet with plenty of food and drink on offer. Boarding was quick and the cabin was on a 1x2x1 layout with 12 seats although there was a larger b/c cabin behind that had about 30 seats. Again food and drinks were plenty full and good quality. Service from the cabin crew was excellent and the cabin manager (Lauren) even made up a birthday card when she found out it was my wife’s special birthday. Departed early and arrived at JFK early as well. The only thing that I disliked was paying £117 each to select our seats and no free wi-fi.
"Not Verified |  Extremely rude ground service. We were non-rev flying and London was our connection/layover. Gate agent was extremely rude and forced me to check my carry on suitcase with the explanation that it was “oversized.” However, when I put it in the sizer, it fit perfectly without force. The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead. The gate agent was insistent and rushed us with no regard for the fact that we would have to redo security in order to get our bags again, as we were switching airlines and needed to carry them on due to our non-rev status. The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service. I understand that it is not a pleasant job and frankly I would not be overjoyed to work there either but that does not explain why we had to be inconvenienced with no fair explanation or attention."
"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc. The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later, that then got delayed by a further three hours. They didn't load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight. Problems happen, it's a complex operation. What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem. The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive, wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off. The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs 'at this time. please try again later'. There is no access to people that are willing to help, empowered to help, or actually move a situation forwards in any way. We've been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days, unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases. The outdated luggage 'tracking system', had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago, where it sat with no-one willing to step up and get it delivered. What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  For the price paid (bought during a sale) it was a decent experience although the club class (business class) seats offer no more legroom than economy class (using short-haul fleet on a 4 hour flight). Fast track through security was not honoured. The lounge at Istanbul airport was over-crowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage, causing a long queue for entry , which was badly organised. Boarding was smooth, cabin crew were friendly but their service was hit-and-miss. Eg. Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t; Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half. However, drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good (with a choice of three mains from the menu)."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled (thanks to strong tail winds). The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks. Nothing at all available to even buy to eat! Worse than a low-cost carrier experience in this sense. One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passenger's head for the whole flight (poor maintenance of cabin). I would choose another airline on this route in the future, as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Very Poor Business class product, BA is not even close to the other airline leaders. Which ever way they sell the seat on a 777 it is a 2-4-2 layout. The cabin feels and is very cramped. The food in business class is economy quality just served in a china dish! However, the price of course is at premier levels. The only positive of the whole fight and return were the cabin crew who were fantastic. I felt genuinely sorry for them having to try and flog such a poor product. Would I fly BA business again? only if their were no other options and I had no choice."
"Not Verified | This review is for LHR-SYD-LHR. BA015 and BA016. Business class had a 1-2-1 configuration on 777 giving space, privacy and easy aisle access. Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed. Good quality pillow and duvet. Privacy with sliding door. Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered."
"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain."
"Not Verified |  Overall not bad. Staff look tired and overworked, trying their best. Weird seats, I was in 21G going, and 21D going home. The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work. There is another button, also very stiff, to bring the “leg rest” out. This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs, but just obstructs your feet really. Again, I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons. At one point, the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline, sit up, or put the “leg rest” back. We gave up and called the flight attendant, who also had trouble. BA: please give this some maintenance! Food: only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec. It was pasta and was not too bad. A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered, but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service? “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube. It was disgusting, same offered on return journey. A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer. The tea and coffee was hot at least. Overall, I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA. I won’t choose BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving."
"✅ Trip Verified | I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future. The lack of assistance, blame-shifting, and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet. I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service."
"Not Verified |  Beware! BA don't provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason. My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money! They said they can't do anything to help, not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets! The most ridiculous thing I've heard!"
"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!"
"Not Verified | All 4 of our flights were fine in terms of comfort, punctuality and service. I feel safe with BA and that is my main reason for booking with them even though I could travel with other airlines more directly. On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed. To serve a chicken sausage in a wrap for a business class breakfast is just unacceptable. Does BA actually pay experts to design these breakfasts? Low point on an otherwise good trip."
"cNot Verified |  I had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa. I’ll never fly BA again."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money. I never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or the actual cost of the flight. I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was ""weather conditions"" although other non-BA flights were going. I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people. Worst service/airline ever."
"✅ Trip Verified | Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes."
"✅ Trip Verified | Once again a terrible business class experience with BA. The flight was delayed by 4.5 hours, The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure. Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays. Having flown Etihad, Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals. "
"✅ Trip Verified |  BA A380's are showing their age, hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours. Cabin crew were good and helpful. Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim. On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didn't work. The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this, if you're prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there."
"✅ Trip Verified |   Credit to BA - Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great. Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. Nice one BA for 2 great flights."
"✅ Trip Verified |   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers. Overall though it was a very nice flight, and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all."
✅ Trip Verified |  The flight took off a little late due to Heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule. Boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient. A small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase. The cabin and toilets were very clean. Overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way!
"✅ Trip Verified | BA is great in the air! But... they sell you connections thru London Heathrow Terminal 5 (their private, BA-only terminal) which you are practically not able to make. 90 minutes stopover time, European flight inbound, transatlantic flight outbound, you arrive at the terminal gate ON TIME and... book, security! Endless line, slow process. Your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the X ray, and then.... it is a train ride withing the same terminal (but different, distant buildings). Almost impossible to make. Lots of stress."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from Lisbon to London. I called to get some assistance from British Airways, hoping for wheelchair assistance, an easier seat to get to, or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg, which was in a cast. This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of €6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so. Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight (on another airline) for me and we were last to board. That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class, for a reasonable price, and took great care of me."
✅ Trip Verified | Check in at MIA straightforward. BA use American flagship lounge near gate D30 which is excellent. Flight delayed but only by 1 hours. Boarding chaotic. On board staff were fine. Seat was fine too but product ageing. Post take off service prompt. Slept for 6 hours. I noticed that in club world BA have ditched rose champagne which is a shame. Pre arrival breakfast was ok. Slow to deplane. Luggage off ok.
"✅ Trip Verified |   Never I saw such a terrible customer experience. The plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays, the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages. After this long 1 hour boarding process, the captain did not apologise.  This is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight, forcing passengers to lose train connections to home."
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having not flown with BA for a few years, I read some of the reviews in preparation, needless to say I boarded this flight with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok. We left LHR a few minutes early and arrived at JNB ahead of schedule. Cabin crew, although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional. Onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta. On board entertainment has never been BA's strong point and sadly that hasn't changed. Unfortunately BA is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as bad (from my experience) as some reviews suggest."
"✅ Trip Verified | Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways. Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look. Frustrated and fed up, Bert"
✅ Trip Verified |  Quick bag drop at First Wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal. Direct entry to Concorde room outside security south. Ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly. Concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent bar. Boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow. On board cabin crew excellent. Good choice of beverages and these were of high quality. Food was good. Seat comfortable. No first bedding provided. On time arrival into Miami. Baggage took 1 hour to arrive
"✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing."
"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages. They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early. We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane. The plane was old, dirty, had no power at the seats. The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight. There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket. British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world-class airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet."
"Not Verified |  Boarded on time, but it took ages to get to the runway due to congestion. Flight was smooth and quick. Snack and drinks were good for a short flight. Landed only about ten minutes late. One bag of three left in London, forms quickly filled in, and the bag was delivered the next morning."
