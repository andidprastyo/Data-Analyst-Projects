## Data Cleaning Projects

**Description**

Welcome to the Data Cleaning Projects repository! This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of data cleaning projects, resources, and best practices to help data enthusiasts, analysts, and scientists tackle the crucial task of data cleaning effectively and efficiently.

**What is Data Cleaning?**

Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data scrubbing, is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in datasets to ensure their quality and reliability. It is an essential step in the data analysis pipeline, as the accuracy of any analysis or machine learning model greatly depends on the quality of the underlying data.

**Why This Repository?**

This repository aims to serve as a hub for all things related to data cleaning. It will host various projects that demonstrate different data cleaning techniques, strategies, and tools used to handle real-world datasets with various challenges. The projects will cover a wide range of domains and industries to showcase the versatility of data cleaning techniques.

What You'll Find:

    Data Cleaning Projects: The heart of this repository will be the collection of data cleaning projects.
